/**
 * LEGACY FILE - Maintained for backward compatibility
 *
 * All utilities have been moved to organized files in ./utils/
 * This file now re-exports everything to maintain existing imports.
 *
 * For new code, consider importing directly from specific utility files:
 * - import { onlyNumbers } from '@/app/lib/utils/formUtils'
 * - import { buildConstituentUpdateData } from '@/app/lib/utils/constituentUtils'
 *
 * Or from the main utils index:
 * - import { onlyNumbers, buildConstituentUpdateData } from '@/app/lib/utils'
 */

export * from "./utils";
